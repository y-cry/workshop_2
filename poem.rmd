You may write me down in history with your bitter,  

twisted lies, 

You may trod me in the very dirt

But still, like dust, I’ll rise.

Does my sassiness upset you? Why are you beset with gloom? 
’Cause I walk like I’ve got oil wells

Pumping in my living room.

Just like moons and like suns, With the certainty of tides 
Just like the hopes springing high, 

Still I’ll rise.
